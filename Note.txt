Negative Margin: We know that vertical margin does't work on inline elements. But there is an exception -- There are two types of inline
                elements - replaced inline elements and non-replaced inline elements.

                Replaced Elements: In CSS, a replaced element is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS; 
                they're external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model.

                Put in simpler terms, they're elements whose contents are not affected by the current document's styles.
                The position of the replaced element can be affected using CSS, but not the contents of the replaced element itself.

                e.g: <img>, <video>, <iframe> etc.
                image is a replaced element because the element is replaced the image itself. it links to another page and retrieves 
                contents from there. For such inline element, vertical margin can be applied -- postive, Negative margins.
                where postive margin push him down and Negative margin push him up!


                Non-replaced Elements: eg- <a> tag etc. for which any type of margin does't work!
